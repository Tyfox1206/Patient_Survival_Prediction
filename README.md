## Overview
When we met as a group, we began discussing what type of project type we would like to do. Most of our group was interested in completing a final project that involved data from the health care industry. From there we began to look for datasets that involved this industry. This type of dataset leans itself well to the classification we are trying to complete for this group assessment. While looking at datasets we looked through a lot of different sets that cover a wild variety of data within in the medical industry. Eventually we found a dataset that is extremely close to the data we were looking for when we originally met.

This dataset is the [“Patient Survival Prediction Dataset.”]( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sadiaanzum/patient-survival-prediction-dataset) This dataset was sourced from Kaggle, and on the Kaggle page it has [“Critical Care Medicine”]( https://journals.lww.com/ccmjournal/Citation/2019/01001/33__THE_GLOBAL_OPEN_SOURCE_SEVERITY_OF_ILLNESS.36.aspx) journal listed as the source. This was a Star Research presentation listed as “The Global Open Source Severity of Illness Score.” With this dataset we are interested in finding out the answer to multiple questions we have regarding this data.

## Questions
 * How accurate can we get a machine learning model with dataset?
 * Is there a difference in Survivability based on the hospital?
 * Top ten features of the data for ICU survivability?


## Communication Protocols
 - Slack – Being used as the hub for general communication between team members.
 - Zoom Meetings – Being used for Voice and video communication when required.
